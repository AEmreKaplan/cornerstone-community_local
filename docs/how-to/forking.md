# How to fork cornerstone-community

Here, we have a visual guide on the submission process flow within CORNERSTONE Community Repository over the web interface of GitHub. *You can use and download the components directly without forking; you can use the repository to fit your needs, and then fork it when you want to contribute.*


Go to the [community repository](https://github.com/cornerstone-uos/cornerstone-community) and "fork" it. Forking allows the user to create a clone of a repository under their own GitHub account, allowing the user to build a personal project based on the source code through version releases without directly modifying the source ([see documentation on GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks) for more details).

Fork-> Create new fork:

This fork will now be hosted in your own user account. It will preserve its tie to the original repository, allowing you to synchronise with it following a content update. GitHub does not allow private forks if the original repository is public.

Forks allow you to submit contents to the original repository through pull requests (which actually creates a submission branch in the original repository).

Congratulations, now you can go on and submit your designs.
