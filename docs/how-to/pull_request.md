# Submit a pull request to cornerstone-community

After you uploaded all the new/modified files and would like to make a submission, select `Open pull request` from `Contribute`. It is a good idea to sync to the latest version of the Community Repository from `Sync fork` and change the referred commit hash keys in the derived/modified components.

This will create a pull request template with a Markdown-format commit message for the contributor to modify and fill (see the template [here](https://github.com/cornerstone-uos/cornerstone-community/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md))

You can preview the commit message (see below) from the `Preview` button above the edit box: To mark a checkbox, swap `[ ]` with `[x]` (alternatively you can directly mark them after submitting the PR).

**Update: Now the users can select different `Basic`, `Advanced` or `Documentation` submission templates. Please use the links in Preview to jump to the desired template.**
