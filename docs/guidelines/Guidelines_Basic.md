# Formatting guidelines: basic 

The submitted components must obey to the fabrication process detailed within the call launch documentation for the specific platform. Please refer to [Design Guidelines](https://www.cornerstone.sotonfab.co.uk/design-rules/) for more information.

CORNERSTONE uses dedicated layers across its platforms to ensure simplicity during fabrication. Please adhere to such layer specifications when creating the design files.

If you aim to submit a component design intended to be used as a building block in a specific platform, please place its GDS file within the relevant platform folder (i.e. `SiN_300nm`, `Si_220nm_active`). If you intend to submit a composite design that is intended to be used as an off-the-shlef design, place it within the `Off_the_shelf_components` folder, with a name suitable for its purpose.



Aside from these, the Community Members do not need to include any other
files in the basic submission. However, the inclusion of numerical and
experimental data regarding the functionality of the components are
encouraged. Relevant files and information can be provided while submitting a pull request, or by [contacting
us](mailto:pdk.cornerstone@soton.ac.uk) about the submission.
